# Goal

1. Collect various ideas and resources to teach a group of children about

   1. Horseshoe crabs
   2. Red Knot (bird)
   3. Ecology related aspects of Horseshoe crabs and Red Knots

2. Make this document available to others for use and contribute ideas/thoughts.

## Age of children

- Primarily for kids above 3 years and upto 12 years
- but also collect resources for elder school going kids

## Geographical limitation

- primarily aimed at the ecology of eastern shore of USA (Delaware, New Jersey)
- but also collect educational resource information for Red Knots and Horseshoe crabs in other parts of the world

# Concepts to teach

- Red Knots travel to Delaware bay from very very far away
- Horseshoe crabs spawn in Delaware bay
- timing of spawning and Red Knots arrival is crucial for the existence of Red Knots
- there are multiple threats to Horseshoe crabs and Red Knots

	- **RED KNOT**
	- Some populations winter as far south as Tierra del Fuego, the southern tip of South America.
	- More than half of the Western hemisphere’s population of Red Knot may be in the Delaware Bay in May.
	- Red Knots may travel 20,000 miles round trip per year making non-stop flights of 2,000 miles or more.
	- More than 90% of their diet at the Delaware Bay consists of horseshoe crab eggs.
	- The weight they gain from horseshoe crab eggs allows them to make their final non-stop flight to their Arctic breeding grounds. 
	- It will also help sustain them during the initial nesting period until food becomes available there.

	- **HORSESHOE CRABS**
	- There are four species of horseshoe crab worldwide. Only one species (Limulus Polyphemus) lives in North America. The largest population is in the Delaware Bay.
	- Horseshoe crabs are not actually crabs. They are arthropods more closely related spiders and scorpions.
	- It takes about 9 years for a horseshoe crab to become sexually mature.
	- During spawning, a female horseshoe crab lays a cluster of about 4,000 eggs several times each night and may lay around 100,000 eggs each season.

	- **RED KNOT**
	- Weighing about as much as a D-size battery, Red Knots fly up to 15,000 km (9,300 miles) during their yearly migration between Arctic breeding grounds and wintering grounds farther south, which for some Red Knots is the southern tip of South America.
	- take a D-cell battery for the kids so that the kids can figure out the weight of a single bird

# Miscellaneous ides/thoughts/comments/suggestions/etc.

- show kids the tag/band used on Red Knots
- show kids the tag/band attached to Horseshoe Crabs
- get a license/permit to display a dead Horseshoe Crab

## my questions (remove this section later)

- where do the horseshoe crabs come from?
  - only from within the Delaware bay OR from the Atlantic ocean?
  - I believe they come from the Atlantic Ocean.
  - how far from the coastline do they come from?
